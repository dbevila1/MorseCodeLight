# MorseCodeLight
This is an mobile android application that takes user input text and outputs it to morse code through the flash in the cell phone. The application was developed in android studio in association with John Yuhe Luan, and Zackary Harnett at the October 2016 Kent State University "Kent Hack Enough" Hackathon.

*My first hackathon.
